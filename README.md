# What's in the Pantry?
What’s In The Pantry is an application that allows a user to input ingredients they currently
have on hand or wish to use in preparation for a meal. Through inputting several ingredients
on hand the application returns a list of recipes from popular recipe sites such as “Food
Network, Tasty, Ruhlman, Martha Stewart and many others”. These recipe cards contains
summary information about the recipe while allowing the user to view the cost of individual
ingredients. Users can find links to the ingredients for online shopping through Amazon while also linking the user to the source recipe site for instructions to prepare.


## User Story
As a home chef:

I want to search for recipes that include key ingredients that I have in my kitchen

I want to know each recipes health labels, so that I can find a recipe that fits my dietary needs
(Gluten free, Vegetarian, etc)

I want to know the cost of recipe ingredients, so I can be cost-effective.

I want to have an easy link to the recipe instructions, so I can get started making the recipe once I choose one.

The user can then click on the "Recipe Cost" button for any recipe to see a list with images of the recipe's ingredients, the ingredient costs, and links to shop for the ingredients online through amazon. 

![Recipe Cost Total](/img/whats-in-the-pantry-recipe-cost-scroll.png)
The user can scroll through that list and find a total recipe cost at the bottom. The cost takes into consideration the ingredients the user already has on hand and does not add those ingredients' costs into the total.

Once a user finds a recipe they like, they can click on the "Recipe Source & Instructions" button for that recipe to open a link to the full recipe in a new tab.
